# Chat ⚡️
## Our Goal
learn how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. We'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

## What you will create
We’re going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
